Synopsis: We demonstrate how one-shot learning can lower the amount of data required to make meaningful predictions in drug discovery. Our architecture, the iterative refinement LSTM, permits the learning of meaningful distance metrics on small-molecule space.


\subsection{Definitions of Graph Primitives}

There are three major neural-network layers that are used to featurizing the molecular graphs. This is the graph convolution, $h_{\rm conv}(G)$, the graph pool, $h_{\rm pool}(G)$, and the graph gather, $h_{\rm gather}(G)$, all defined below. The graph convolution and graph pool operations definitions are given for a single node in the graph $v\in V$; however, when performing the operation on the graph, $G$, the operation is performed on all nodes simultaneously. This means that $h_{\rm conv}(G) = [h_{\rm conv}(v_1), h_{\rm conv}(v_2),\dots]$, and similarly for the pool layer. Specifically, we define
%\begin{equation*}
%\mathbf{h}_i^\prime, \mathbf{c}_i^\prime = 
%\begin{cases}
%{\rm{LSTM0}}\left(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{h}_i,\mathbf{c}_i\right) &\mbox{if } %\mathbf{y}_i=0\\
%{\rm{LSTM1}}\left(\mathbf{u}_i,\mathbf{h}_i,\mathbf{c}_i\right) &\mbox{if } \mathbf{y}_i=1
%\end{cases}
%\end{equation*}
%Then 
%\begin{equation*}
%\mathbf{h}^\prime,\mathbf{c}^\prime = %{\rm{LSTM}}\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{h},\mathbf{c}\mid \mathbf{y}\right)
%\end{equation*}
\begin{align*}
h_{\rm{conv}}(v) &= \sigma\left(\sum\limits_{(u,v)\in E} W^{{\rm{deg}}(v)}v + U^{{\rm{deg}}(v)}u + b^{{\rm{deg}}(v)}\right) \\
h_{\rm{pool}}(v) &= \max\left\{\max\limits_{(u,v)\in E} u, v\right \} \\
h_{\rm{gather}}(G) &= \sum_{u\in V} u\\
\end{align*}
where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is a nonlinearity, such as ReLU or tanh.

\subsection{Convolutional Architecture in this Paper}

The Graph Conv, Siamese, AttnLSTM, and IterRefLSTM models all used the same convolutional architecture, shown in the table below, with the input starting at the left, sequentially feeding into the layers to the right.

We note that we did not make a focused effort at hyperparameter optimization in this work. Once we found the basic architecture below (by analogy with image convolutional networks), we proceeded with experimental evaluation. We leave thorough hyperparameter optimization to future work.

\begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{ r | c | c | c | c | c | c | c | c |}
    \cline{2-9}
    layer & conv & pool & conv & pool & conv & pool & dense & gather\\
    dimension & 64 & & 128 & & 64 & & 128 &\\
    nonlinarity & relu & & relu & & relu & & tanh & tanh\\
    \cline{2-9}
    \end{tabular}
    
    \captionof{table}{Convolutional Network Architecture}
\end{table}

\subsection{Iterative Refinement LSTM Architecture in this paper}

The IterRefLSTM model and AttnLSTM model both use cosine similarity functions, $k(x,y) = \frac{x\cdot y}{ \left\|x\right\|\left\|y\right\|}$. All LSTMs used in this paper have an tanh activation, and hard sigmoid inner activation.

\subsection{Molecular Features}

For the convolutional models, all molecules were featurized into graphs by considering atoms as nodes and bonds as edges in an undirected graph. No distinction was made between bond types. RDKit \cite{landrum2016} was used to compute basic features of atoms including atom-type, valences, formal charges, and hybridization for each atom in a given molecule. This set  of features formed the initial set of atomic features fed into graph-convolutional layers. 

\subsection{Details of Model Training}
This section provides further information on model training procedures. All code for this paper is open-sourced, so we refer interested readers to the actual code within DeepChem for exact implementation details.
\paragraph{One-shot models}
When training a model on a dataset collection, assays within that collection are split into training assays and testing assays. For Tox21, 9 assays are reserved for training, 3 for testing. For SIDER, 21 assays are reserved for training, and 6 for testing. For MUV, 12 assays are reserved for training, and 5 models are reserved for testing. See following appendix sections for listings of training/testing assays for each collection.

As mentioned previously, training for one-shot models consists of a sequence of episodes. In each episode, an assay from the training assays is randomly sampled, then a support $S$ of size $n_\textrm{pos} + n_\textrm{neg}$ and a batch of queries $B$ (of size $128$) are sampled from the task. In the experimental tables, we use short-hand 10+/10- or 1+/5- to respectively represent $n_\textrm{pos} = 10, n_\textrm{neg}=10$ and $n_\textrm{pos}=1,n_\textrm{neg}=5$. Models were trained for $2000\cdot n_\textrm{train}$ episodes, where $n_\textrm{train}$ was the number of training assays for that dataset collection. Each episode takes one gradient descent step minimizing $\mathcal{L}$, using ADAM \cite{kingma2014adam}.

At test time, the accuracy of a one-shot model is evaluated separately on each testing assay. For a given test assay, a support of size $n_\textrm{pos} + n_\textrm{neg}$ is sampled at random from datapoints for that assay. The ROC-AUC score for the one-shot model is evaluated on the remainder of the datapoints for the test assay (excluding the support). This procedure is reported $20$ times for each test assay, and the mean and standard deviations of computed ROC-AUC scores for each test assay are presented in the tables in the appendix. For the tables in the body of the paper, the mean and standard deviations of computed ROC-AUC scores is only presented for the ``median task''. That is, for the test assay whose mean ROC-AUC score (over sampled supports) is the median of the set of mean ROC-AUC scores (over all test assays).

\paragraph{Singletask models}
Random forests were trained on circular fingerprint representations of input molecules \cite{rogers2010extended}. For each test assay, supports of size $n_\textrm{pos} + n_\textrm{neg}$ are sampled at random. The random forest model is trained on this sampled supported set, and evaluated on the remainder of test assay. This procedure is repeated $20$ times (note that a different random forest is trained for each newly sampled support). Means and standard deviations are reported as for one-shot models.

Singletask graph convolutional networks are trained as the random forests are, but with graph convolutional features instead of circular fingerprint representations.
